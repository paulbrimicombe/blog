# About meâ€¦

My name is <a href="https://www.github.com/paulbrimicombe" target="_blank" referrer-policy="none">Paul Brimicombe</a> and I currently work in the UK as a software engineer for the BBC. All views expressed are my own and do not in any way represent the BBC.

Before that I worked as a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=%22p+brimicombe%22&btnG=" target="_blank" referrer-policy="none">research scientist</a> mostly investigating Liquid Crystals and Liquid Crystal Devices.
